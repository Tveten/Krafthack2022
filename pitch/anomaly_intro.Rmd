## Overview

## Data findings
- High correlation
- Jump in strain after burnin
- Strain on bolt increase with time, at least for variables near the crack
- 

## Model considerations
We have used a simple linear regression models with all possible interactions of the following variables: 
- timepoints  
- Unit_4_Power
- Turbine_Guide_Vane_Opening   
- Turbine_Pressure_Drafttube
- Turbine_Pressure_Spiral_Casing
- Turbine_Rotational_Speed
- mode

We have also included two additional "modes" as a pre-processing step. 

## Model considerations
The linear model is simple, with its only flexibility coming from interactions

- Crossplots reveal that many relationships are linear or near-linear


## Putting it into production

## Scalability and transferability

## Other things to do
- Possible smoothing of signal
- Fit robust models
- Anomaly detection
