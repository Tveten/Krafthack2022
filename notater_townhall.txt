About the case
Water flow dynamics are challenging, particularly when you need to regulate 538 meters of water and simultaneously consider the needs from the power market.

Kvilldal is equipped with four Francis turbines, which are fundamental to generating over 3 000 GWh of energy every single year. These turbines are subject to an ever-changing environment with complex load requirements, as they need to start, stop, and adjust to varying water conditions. These changing loads result in stresses on the structure, and it is vital to monitor the turbine to minimize forces on the turbine components and maintain a high level of safety.

In this challenge, Statkraft will share a real data set collected from one of the turbines installed in the Kvilldal plant. The turbine is equipped with multiple sensors, including strain gauges, with supporting operational data (power, speed...).

The dataset will be provided in a table format and made available as CSV files (or other tabular equivalent). The dataset will be pre-processed to accommodate for known data errors (e.g. lost connectivity, sensor reliability) to allow attendees to focus on the modeling rather than data preparation.



Data:
* Do we get training data only? Test data only for evaluation?
* How is quantitative testing done?
  - Automatic after we deliver some model?
  - What performance measures?
